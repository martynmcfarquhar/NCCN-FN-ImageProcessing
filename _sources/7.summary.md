# Summary

In this lesson we have explored a number of topics from the world of image processing. This is a vast area and we have now covered a lot of ground. There may well be quite a few new concepts that you will need to grapple with, such as voxel-space and world-space, transformations as changes in coordinates, the concept of interpolation and thinking of filtering as convolution with a kernel. These topics can all be difficult to get a handle on if you are not used to thinking about images in this way. As we advance on the course, we will see many of these different elements come up again. As such, you are not expected to be an expert by this point. However, you should be starting to gain familiarity with all these concepts so that they are not alien when they come up again in Image Analysis and Advanced Image Analysis. So, try to get to grips with some of the core ideas in this lesson so that you are better prepared for seeing image processing in the context of analysing fMRI data, as well as other forms of data such as PET, anatomical MRI and DTI.
