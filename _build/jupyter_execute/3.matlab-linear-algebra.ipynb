    "# MATLAB and Linear Algebra\n",
    "As mentioned in the previous section, `SPM` is a software package that is built *on top* of the `MATLAB` scientific computing environment. Although possible to use `SPM` without any further knowledge of `MATLAB`, there is an argument to be made for being at least a *bit* familiar with the `MATLAB` language. Unfortunately, we do not have time on this course for in-depth training on computer programming. However, we can start using `MATLAB` as a way of understanding some of the mathematical theory that we will need going forward. This will do double-duty as a way of getting familiar with `MATLAB`, as well as a way of learning some mathematical concepts in a more interactive fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The MATLAB Prompt\n",
    "In order to communicate with `MATLAB`, we use the `MATLAB` prompt. The prompt is signified in the Command Window by the two angled brackets `>>`. These brackets indicate where we can type commands for `MATLAB` to interpret. We type something at the prompt, hit <kbd>ENTER</kbd> and then whatever we typed gets sent to the interpreter. If `MATLAB` understands what we typed, it will return the answer. If `MATLAB` does not understand what we typed, it will return an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, if we wanted to use `MATLAB` as a highly over-engineered calculator, we could ask what $3 \\times 4$ is by typing"

One of the most basic characteristics of any programming language is the ability to store data in memory for later use. We do this by using *variables*, which you can think of as boxes with names that we can put data inside to keep for later. As an example, the code below shows the declaration of a variable called `a` and assigning it the number 5."

    "We have now covered matrix addition, subtraction and multiplication. So what about matrix division? Unfortunately, this is where things get complicated again. To start with, let us review a particular way of viewing division of normal numbers. As we should all know, division is simply splitting a number into equal parts. However, we can also view this as a *multiplication*. Specifically, multiplication by the *inverse* of another number. For instance\n",
