    "In the previous section, we introduced the idea of two different coordinates systems we can use when working with images. In order to use both systems, we need to be able to convert between them. So, we need to be able to take voxel coordinates and convert them into millimetres, as well as take millimetre coordinates and convert them into voxels.\n",

You might also recognise that this is therefore a system of 3 linear equations, which can be represented using matrices. As such, we can compactly represent this transformation in the form $\\mathbf{B} = \\mathbf{MA}$, which we can expand to\n",

Multiplying a vector containing our original coordinates by $\\mathbf{M}$ will give us the coordinates transformed into the alternative space. We can also use $\\mathbf{M}^{-1}$ to convert from the transformed coordinates back into the original coordinates using $\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{M}^{-1}\\mathbf{B}$. "

    "Now that we have seen how affine transformations work, we can get back to the idea of converting between voxel-space and world-space. The key thing to understand is that this conversion is just an affine transformation, consisting of translating, rotating and scaling the axes so they represent millimetres instead of voxels. This process is illustrated in {numref}``."
