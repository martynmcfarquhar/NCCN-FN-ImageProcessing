    "# Image Filtering\n",
    "We are now going to move on from spatial transformations to talk about image filtering. We are not going to spend as mutch time on filtering because spatial transformations are both more common and are also the source of more errors compare to filtering. That being said, filtering is still frequently used and discussing it here will allow us to first approach topics such as convolution, which will come in handy later in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be mainly discussing filters in their most intuitive form within the spatial domain. This means we are dealing with methods that directly change the voxel values of the image. We will introduce the idea of filters within the frequency domain a little later on, for those who would like a slightly different perspective. However, the main point is to understand how filters can be applied spatially to an image. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Kernels\n",
    "The key to understanding how image filtering works is to understand the concept of a *kernel*. A kernel is a small matrix used to weight the voxel values to produce new values in an image. The idea is that we slide the kernel across the image and then calculate a new value for the voxel the kernel is *centred* on, using all the voxels the kernel is covering. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, we are going to use a Gaussian kernel, which is used in neuroimaging to *smooth* or *blur* images. Smoothing is a technique to reduce noise in an image because the Gaussian kernel performs a weighted averaging of neighbouring voxels. This means that random noise across voxels will tend to cancel-out, whereas values that are consistent across voxels will tend to remain. An example of a 3 x 3 Gaussian kernel is shown below\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The values in the kernel are derived from a Gaussian distribution (also known as the *normal* distribution), which is easier to see when visualised in 3D, as shown in {numref}`gauss-kern-fig` for a $17 \\times 17$  kernel.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the *width* of a normal distribution is usually controlled by its *standard deviation* (represented by $\\sigma$). In neuroimaging, however, it is more typical to talk about the *Full Width at Half Maximum* (FWHM) value in the context of a smoothing kernel. This value gives the number of voxels the kernel covers at half its height, as illustrated in {numref}`FWHM-fig`. Parameterising the kernel in this fashion means we can think about the coverage of the kernel more intuitively in terms of voxels. The standard deviation and FWHM are connected, as shown by the formula \n",

    "\n",
    "In terms of how this kernel would be used to smooth an image, {numref}`smoothing-kernel-fig` tries to visualise the process. We can see that the kernel is placed over a patch of voxels and then the overlapping values are multiplied and summed to produce a value of 123.77. This process is more formally known as *convolution* and will be explored a little more below. The number 123.77 becomes the new value of the voxel the kernel is *centred on*, as indicated by the arrow. Continuing through the image in this manner produces the smoothed version of the image you can see on the right.\n",

    "## Convolution\n",
    "As mentioned above, the process of multiplying a kernel and an image to produce a new value is an example of a more general mathematical procedure called *convolution*. This is a procedure that we are going to encounter in a few places on this course, so it is worth a little bit of time discussing it now. To formalise this, the 1D convolution of a Gaussian kernel ($g$) and an image ($i$) at voxel $n$ would be written as\n",

    "$$\n",
    "(i \\ast g)[n] = \\sum_{m = -M}^{M} i[n-m]g[m]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the indices of the kernel run from $-M$ to $M$. All this means is that you should work through all the voxels that overlap between the kernel and the image, calculate the product of the overlapping values and then add them together.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main thing to understand in the formula above is that $i$ and $g$ could be *any functions*. Convolution is a very general process that creates a new function from two input functions. In our example, the new function is the smoothed spatial signal and the inputs are the un-smoothed spatial signal and the kernel. However, these could be anything. For example, the GIF below shows the convolution of a square function and curved-triangle function.\n",

    "Hopefully the similarities to running a kernel over an image are clear in these examples. We will see convolution coming up again when we come to analysing fMRI data, so make sure you have some sense of how it works here as it will make the more complex fMRI application easier to understand.\n",

    "## Smoothing in SPM\n",
    "We have used smoothing as our filtering example in this section because this is one of the key steps that we will use when processing fMRI images. Although there are many other potential filters, the Gaussian filter has become a mainstay of neuroimaging data analysis. In SPM this is implemented as a convolution operation. In the video below you will see how to use the SPM smoothing module to apply a Gaussian filter to an image.

    "## Filters in the Frequency Domain\n",
    "Beyond conceptualising filters as spatial convolution, it is also possible to view filters within the *frequency*-domain. Here, we think about how filters affect both high-frequency and low-frequency spatial information. The outcome is the same as spatial filters and so this alternative perspective is mainly useful from a perspective of understanding what filters are doing. As such, we have left this as an advanced topic for those who wish to know a bit more. You can read about this perspective using the advanced drop-down section below."
