# Summary

In this lesson we have explored some of the key computational tools we will need on the course going forward. We discussed the structure and representation of medical images on a computer, before introducing both `MATLAB` and `SPM` as key tools for manipulating images on a computer. We then discussed using `MATLAB` for basic linear algebraic operations as a means of both learning some basic `MATLAB` syntax, and as a means of getting acquainted with some of the mathematical theory we will need. Although the context is slightly missing at present, we will see how all these elements come together over the coming weeks. As such, you should now have some familiarity with all these ideas, though you may wish to revisit this lesson as a refresher as some of these concepts begin coming up again in future units.
