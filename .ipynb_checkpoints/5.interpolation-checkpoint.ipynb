    "# Interpolation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous sections, we looked at how to map coordinates between different spaces and saw how we could use this mapping to perform a transformation in voxel-space. However, during this step we glossed over quite an important detail. In the example, we showed how the voxel coordinates changed for a shift of 9mm. This was chosen very specifically to be an *exact multiple* of the voxel size. But what happens if we want to move the image by some other amount? What if we want to move the image by 8mm, or 3.75mm, or any other value that is not an exact multiple of the voxel size? \n",

    "To see what happens, first we will define a $\\mathbf{T}$ to enact a translation of 8mm backwards along the $y$-axis\n",

    "Make sure you take a moment to consider why this result is problematic. Remembering that $\\mathbf{Q}$ transforms voxel coordinates from the *new* space into voxel coordinates from the *old* space, we have an issue because there is no voxel 22.667 in the original image. In fact, this cannot exist because voxel coordinates are indices into the data matrix and therefore cannot have fractional values. As such, if we wanted to use this $\\mathbf{Q}$ to created a voxel-space transformation, what can we do?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is that we have to *estimate* what value would be 66.7% of the way between voxels 22 and 23 in the original image. This estimation procedure is known as *interpolation* (sometimes called *resampling*, *regriding* or *reslicing*). When we interpolate a value we have to use the voxel values surrounding the desired point to make an informed decision about what value voxel 22.667 would have. This may sound unintuitive, given that voxel 22.667 does not exist. However, remember that when we measure the MR signal we are taking discrete samples of a signal that varies *continuously* across the brain. So, in reality, there would have been some value 66.7% of the way between our samples, we just did not measure it. As such, interpolation is about trying to recover the shape of the original spatial signal so we can estimate what this value might have been."

    "## Nearest-neighbour Interpolation\n",
    "\n",
    "The first and most basic approach we could take to finding a value for voxel $[20, 22.667, 20]$ is to pick the value *closest* to these coordinates. This is the same as *rounding* the coordinates, so when faced with coordinates $[20, 22.667, 20]$ we round them to the nearest whole-numbers to give $[20, 23, 20]$. The voxel at $[20, 23, 20]$ is therefore the *nearest-neighbour* to our desired point and thus and becomes the value we use as our estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest advantage of nearest-neighbour interpolation is that it is very simple and computationally fast. Nearest-neighbour is also the only interpolation method that *does not create new values*, as the interpolated values are only ever repeats of what was originally in the image. All other interpolation methods can create new values that were never in the image in the first place. As such, for cases where you want to preserve the original data values, nearest-neighbour is the only choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nearest-neighbour interpolation is visualised below. On the left is a graph showing interpolation in a single dimension, where the green circles represent the original voxel values and the dashed lines represented the in-between values estimated by nearest-neighbour interpolation. On the right is an example of an image that has been interpolated using the nearest-neighbour approach. Notice that is has a characteristically \"blocky\" appearance, which matches with the sharp changes in values shown in the graph. Remembering that the aim of interpolation is to try and recreate the original spatial signal, it is unlikely that the true signal looked like the dashed line. Nearest-neighbour is therefore the most inaccurate interpolation method, from both a signal-recreation perspective and a visual perspective.\n",
