    "In the first part of this lesson we are going to be focusing on *spatial transformations*. We will spend more time discussing this form of image processing as spatial methods are relevant to a much wider variety of analysis steps. Spatial transformations are also where more errors will occur, and so warrant more of our attention.\n",

    "We can conceptualise an MRI image as a 3D matrix (like a big cube), where we can refer to any voxel within the cube using an index along each dimension. Typically we refer to these dimensions as $x$, $y$ and $z$, where $x$ corresponds to the *row*, $y$ corresponds to the *column* and $z$ corresponds to the *slice*. An index into an image is therefore a *triplet* of values that indicates how far along each of the dimensions we need to travel in order to find the value we want. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, the `MATLAB` code below shows the process of loading an image (which you can download from [here](https://livemanchesterac.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/sites/UOM-FBMH-MSc-NCCN/Shared%20Documents/PCHN62141%20Functional%20Neuroanatomy/Learning%20Materials/Asynchronous/Week%204/2.%20Image%20Processing/Data/example_image.nii?csf=1&web=1&e=Haernk&download=1)) and then extracting a value using the voxel coordinates $x = 180$, $y = 180$ and $z = 110$. This tells `MATLAB` that we want to travel $180$ voxels along the $x$ dimension, $180$ voxels along the $y$ dimension, $110$ voxels along the $z$ dimension and then extract the value found at that location."
